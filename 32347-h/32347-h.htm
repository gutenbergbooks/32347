</p>

<p>Commander Benedict kept
his eyes on the rear plate as he
activated the intercom. "All right,
cut the power. We ought to be safe
enough here."</p>

<p>As he released the intercom, Dr.
Leicher, of the astronomical staff,
stepped up to his side. "Perfectly
safe," he nodded, "although even
at this distance a star going nova
ought to be quite a display."</p>

<p>Benedict didn't shift his gaze
from the plate. "Do you have your
instruments set up?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. But we have plenty
of time. The light won't reach us
for several hours yet. Remember,
we were outracing it at ten lights."</p>

<p>The commander finally turned,
slowly letting his breath out in a
soft sigh. "Dr. Leicher, I would say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
that this is just about the foulest
coincidence that could happen to
the first interstellar vessel ever to
leave the Solar System."</p>

<p>Leicher shrugged. "In one way
of thinking, yes. It is certainly true
that we will never know, now,
whether Alpha Centauri A ever had
any planets. But, in another way,
it is extremely fortunate that we
should be so near a stellar explosion
because of the wealth of scientific
information we can obtain. As
you say, it is a coincidence, and
probably one that happens only
once in a billion years. The chances
of any particular star going nova
are small. That we should be so
close when it happens is of a vanishingly
small order of probability."</p>

<p>Commander Benedict took off his
cap and looked at the damp stain
in the sweatband. "Nevertheless,
Doctor, it is damned unnerving to
come out of ultradrive a couple of
hundred million miles from the
first star ever visited by man and
have to turn tail and run because
the damned thing practically blows
up in your face."</p>

<p>Leicher could see that Benedict
was upset; he rarely used the same
profanity twice in one sentence.</p>

<p>They had been downright lucky,
at that. If Leicher hadn't seen the
star begin to swell and brighten, if
he hadn't known what it meant, or
if Commander Benedict hadn't
been quick enough in shifting the
ship back into ultradrive&mdash;Leicher
had a vision of an incandescent
cloud of gaseous metal that had
once been a spaceship.</p>

<p>The intercom buzzed. The commander
answered, "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Sir, would you tell Dr. Leicher
that we have everything set up
now?"</p>

<p>Leicher nodded and turned to
leave. "I guess we have nothing to
do now but wait."</p>

<p>When the light from the nova
did come, Commander Benedict
was back at the plate again&mdash;the
forward one, this time, since the
ship had been turned around in order
to align the astronomy lab in
the nose with the star.</p>

<p>Alpha Centauri A began to
brighten and spread. It made Benedict
think of a light bulb connected
through a rheostat, with someone
turning that rheostat, turning it until
the circuit was well overloaded.</p>

<p>The light began to hurt Benedict's
eyes even at that distance and
he had to cut down the receptivity
in order to watch. After a while,
he turned away from the plate. Not
because the show was over, but simply
because it had slowed to a point
beyond which no change seemed to
take place to the human eye.</p>

<p>Five weeks later, much to Leicher's
chagrin, Commander Benedict
announced that they had to leave
the vicinity. The ship had only
been provisioned to go to Alpha
Centauri, scout the system without
landing on any of the planets, and
return. At ten lights, top speed for
the ultradrive, it would take better
than three months to get back.</p>

<p>"I know you'd like to watch it
go through the complete cycle,"
Benedict said, "but we can't go back
home as a bunch of starved skeletons."</p>

<p>Leicher resigned himself to the
necessity of leaving much of his
work unfinished, and, although he
knew it was a case of sour grapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
consoled himself with the thought
that he could as least get most of
the remaining information from the
five-hundred-inch telescope on Luna,
four years from then.</p>

<p>As the ship slipped into the not-quite-space
through which the ultradrive
propelled it, Leicher began
to consolidate the material he had
already gathered.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Commander Benedict
wrote in the log:</p>

<p><i>Fifty-four days out from Sol. Alpha
Centauri has long since faded
back into its pre-blowup state, since
we have far outdistanced the light
from its explosion. It now looks as
it did two years ago. It</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Commander,"
Leicher interrupted, "But I have
something interesting to show you."</p>

<p>Benedict took his fingers off the
keys and turned around in his chair.
"What is it, Doctor?"</p>

<p>Leicher frowned at the papers in
his hands. "I've been doing some
work on the probability of that explosion
happening just as it did, and
I've come up with some rather
frightening figures. As I said before,
the probability was small. A
little calculation has given us some
information which makes it even
smaller. For instance: with a possible
error of plus or minus two
seconds Alpha Centauri A began to
explode the instant we came out of
ultradrive!</p>

<p>"Now, the probability of that occurring
comes out so small that it
should happen only once in ten to
the four hundred sixty-seventh
seconds."</p>

<p>It was Commander Benedict's
turn to frown. "So?"</p>

<p>"Commander, the entire universe
is only about ten to the seventeenth
seconds old. But to give you an
idea, let's say that the chances of
its happening are <i>once</i> in millions
of trillions of years!"</p>

<p>Benedict blinked. The number,
he realized, was totally beyond his
comprehension&mdash;or anyone else's.</p>

<p>"Well, so what? Now it has happened
that one time. That simply
means that it will almost certainly
never happen again!"</p>

<p>"True. But, Commander, when
you buck odds like that and win,
the thing to do is look for some factor
that is cheating in your favor.
If you took a pair of dice and started
throwing sevens, one right after
another&mdash;<i>for the next couple of
thousand years</i>&mdash;you'd begin to
suspect they were loaded."</p>

<p>Benedict said nothing; he just
waited expectantly.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing that
could have done it. Our ship."
Leicher said it quietly, without emphasis.</p>

<p>"What we know about the hyperspace,
or superspace, or whatever
it is we move through in ultradrive
is almost nothing. Coming out of
it so near to a star might set up
some sort of shock wave in normal
space which would completely disrupt
that star's internal balance, resulting
in the liberation of unimaginably
vast amounts of energy, causing
that star to go nova. We can
only assume that we ourselves were
the fuze that set off that nova."</p>

<p>Benedict stood up slowly. When
he spoke, his voice was a choking
whisper. "You mean the sun&mdash;Sol&mdash;might...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Leicher nodded. "I don't
say that it definitely would. But
the probability is that we were the
cause of the destruction of Alpha
Centauri A, and therefore might
cause the destruction of Sol in the
same way."</p>

<p>Benedict's voice was steady again.
"That means that we can't go back
again, doesn't it? Even if we're not
positive, we can't take the chance."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. We can get
fairly close before we cut out the
drive, and come in the rest of the
way at sub-light speed. It'll take
longer, and we'll have to go on half
or one-third rations, but we <i>can</i> do
it!"</p>

<p>"How far away?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what the minimum
distance is, but I do know how
we can gage a distance. Remember,
neither Alpha Centauri B or C
were detonated. We'll have to cut
our drive at least as far away from
Sol as they are from A."</p>

<p>"I see." The commander was silent
for a moment, then: "Very
well, Dr. Leicher. If that's the safest
way, that's the only way."</p>

<p>Benedict issued the orders, while
Leicher figured the exact point at
which they must cut out the drive,
and how long the trip would take.
The rations would have to be cut
down accordingly.</p>

<p>Commander Benedict's mind
whirled around the monstrousness
of the whole thing like some dizzy
bee around a flower. What if there
had been planets around Centauri
A? What if they had been inhabited?
Had he, all unwittingly, killed
entire races of living, intelligent beings?</p>

<p>But, how could he have known?
The drive had never been tested
before. It couldn't be tested inside
the Solar System&mdash;it was too fast.
He and his crew had been volunteers,
knowing that they might die
when the drive went on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Benedict gasped and
slammed his fist down on the desk
before him.</p>

<p>Leicher looked up. "What's the
matter, Commander?"</p>

<p>"Suppose," came the answer,
"Just suppose, that we have the
same effect on a star when we <i>go
into</i> ultradrive as we do when we
come out of it?"</p>

<p>Leicher was silent for a moment,
stunned by the possibility. There
was nothing to say, anyway. They
could only wait....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A little more than half a light
year from Sol, when the ship reached
the point where its occupants
could see the light that had left
their home sun more than seven
months before, they watched it become
suddenly, horribly brighter.
<i>A hundred thousand times brighter!</i></p>

<p class="center">... THE END</p>
